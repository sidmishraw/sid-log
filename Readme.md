# Sid's Log

This is the source code of my personal website.

I use [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) as my static-site generator.

The *React* components used in my blog's [Projects page](https://sidmishraw.github.io/projects.html) are located in the following repos:

* [gitHubLike](https://github.com/sidmishraw/gitHubLike).

* [gitlangcards](https://github.com/sidmishraw/gitlangcards)

Give them a go if you like them :)

Currently, I'm adopting Materialized-CSS, the website's appearance will keep changing till I find it awesome :)
