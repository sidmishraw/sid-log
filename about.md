title: About
---

I'm a *Computer Science* graduate student at *San Jos√© State University* and specialize in *software design and development*.

I enjoy programming and usually spend my time developing applications that make my life easier (might not be good enough for others though :D). Presently, I'm enamored by *Haskell* and *Functional Programming(FP)*.

Recently, I've been reading up on the *Software Transactional Memory(STM)*, and it's fascinating. Seeing it in action within Haskell is very inspiring. Being inspired by Haskell's take on STM, I've been trying to implement an STM in Java. You can find the prototypes in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sidmishraw/).
