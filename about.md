I'm a Computer Science graduate student at San Jos√© State University and specialize in software design and development. I enjoy programming and usually spend my time developing applications that make my life easier. Presently, I'm enamored by Software Transactional Memory and Functional Programming(FP). I've been reading about Software Transactional Memory (STM), and it's really fascinating. Seeing it in action within Haskell is very inspiring. Henceforth, I've been trying to implement an STM in Java and Go. The prototypes can be found on my GitHub.
